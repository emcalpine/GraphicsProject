So my function that generates random branches off the main path still needs a bot of work.  I wanted to get this out to everyone else in the mean time.  This is how I thought we divied it up.

o Create a random map

- This is working.  It is as follows.
- 0 = Out of bounds
- 1 = In Play but undefined
- 3 = Start Point
- 4 = End Point
- 5 = Main Path
- 6 = Branch Path
